# RustSploit
RustSploit is a project where we create a free-to-use and open-source Roblox executor for people to use and also for developers to learn more about Rust and hopefully use it more in their projects.

# Stuff needed to build<br>
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE RUST INSTALLED https://www.rust-lang.org/<br>
then run this command `rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc` <br>
run this for build `cargo build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc --release`

# UWP Support<br>
This works post-byfron with the Universal Windows Application version of Roblox
